        "Extended the functionality of state of the art diffusion based protein models to work within our existing \
         generation system. Building on an opensource model, adding in conditional generation options whilst \
maintaining the prior performance. Built in Pytorch. \
Led the design of a novel protein optimization platform, bringing together numerous protein property prediction, \
interaction, and numerical models. This technology is a core feature of Ordaosâ€™ offerings and has been able to \
improve binding by 10x, with resilience to target evolution.",
